# 2DRPG
 
This is a small-scale game developed in Unity.
The premises of this game is that you play as a soldier being transferred into a digital world and have to venture your way through an unique world to get out.

This game serves more of an educational purpose to myself rather than a commercial purpose. Therefore this game is free to be picked up and further developed by anyone wanting to work on it, read the code base I made and everything.
